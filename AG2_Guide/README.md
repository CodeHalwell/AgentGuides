## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation (2 minutes)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv ag2_env
source ag2_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ag2_env\Scripts\activate

# Install AG2 with OpenAI support
pip install ag2[openai]
```

### Set Up API Keys (2 minutes)

Create `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` file:

```json
[
    {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "api_key": "sk-your-key-here"
    }
]
```

Or use environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
```

### Run Your First Agent (5 minutes)

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig

llm_config = LLMConfig.from_json("OAI_CONFIG_LIST")

agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    human_input_mode="NEVER"
)

print("AG2 is ready!")
```
