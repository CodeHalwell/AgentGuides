## 📖 Key Concepts (2025 Edition)

### Why Agents SDK Over Swarm?

| Feature | Swarm (❌ Deprecated) | Agents SDK (✅ Production) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Status** | Experimental | Production-Ready |
| **Guardrails** | None | Built-in Input/Output |

### Design Philosophy
The SDK emphasises:
- **Simplicity**: Minimal abstractions and intuitive APIs
- **Customisation**: Extensible architecture for specific needs
- **Production-Readiness**: Built-in support for tracing, sessions, and error handling
- **Model Agnosticity**: Support for OpenAI and 100+ other LLM providers via LiteLLM
- **Active Maintenance**: Regular updates, security patches, new features

## 🔗 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The SDK includes first-class support for the Model Context Protocol, enabling:
- Integration with MCP servers (filesystem, git, web tools, etc.)
- Hosted MCP connectors with approval workflows
- Custom MCP server creation
- SSE streaming and secure remote execution

## 📊 Session Management

Choose from multiple session backends:
- **SQLite**: File-based storage (default, suitable for most applications)
- **Redis**: Distributed, high-performance session storage
- **SQLAlchemy**: Support for any database backend
- **OpenAI Backend**: Managed session storage via OpenAI's infrastructure

## 🛡️ Safety and Compliance

The SDK provides comprehensive guardrail support:
- **Input Guardrails**: Validate and filter user inputs before processing
- **Output Guardrails**: Validate and filter agent responses before returning
- **Custom Validation**: Create domain-specific safety checks
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Pydantic validation

## 📈 Observability

Built-in features include:
- **Tracing**: Visualise and debug agent flows
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive event tracking
- **Token Counting**: Monitor usage and costs
- **Integration**: Connect to Langfuse, AgentOps, Braintrust, and more
